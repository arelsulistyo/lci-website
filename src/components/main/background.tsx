        Traditional anomaly detection methods in industries like security,
        infrastructure, and environmental monitoring often rely on manual
        inspections or outdated systems, leading to delays and increased risks.
        As threats become more complex, there is a growing need for smarter,
        real-time solutions. AI-powered drones like Xypher address this need by
        providing fast, accurate, and scalable anomaly detection, helping
        businesses identify and respond to issues quickly, reducing operational
        risks and costs.
